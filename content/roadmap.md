The future of __RAD Theme Engine__

---

Like any piece of software, RAD Theme Engine is constantly evolving to fit the needs of our team. Here are some of our current plans regarding the future of the project:

#### Near Future:

- Caching, optimizing page load times.
- PostCSS integration
  - With this would come support for Tailwind CSS
- WordPress Rest API Integration
  - Routing options

#### Farther Down the Line:

- Admin control pages
- Deprecating ACF in favor of the WP block editor
