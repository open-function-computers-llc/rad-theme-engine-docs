## Check for updates

The [`composer outdated`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#outdated) command will check the registry to see if your local installation of the package is outdated:

```bash
composer outdated open-function-computers-llc/rad-theme-engine
```

## Update packages

The [`composer update`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#update-u) command can update either all of your packages or just `rad-theme-engine`:

```bash
# All Packages
composer update

# Just rad-theme-engine
composer update open-function-computers-llc/rad-theme-engine
```
