### Philosophy

The purpose of better-wordpress is to enable developers to use the familiar model-view-controller pattern in the creation of WordPress themes. This is accomplished by keeping HTML and PHP code as seperated as possible and adding convenient methods to organize data before it's sent to the view controllers.

### Install

<!-- Check out the [Installation]({{< relref "installation" >}}) -->
 page for information on how to include better-wordpress in your theme.
