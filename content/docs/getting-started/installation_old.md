### Requirements

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This package uses Composer for dependancy management. If you don't already have Composer installed, follow <a href='https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md'>this guide</a> for your system. If you're planning on using better-wordpress in multiple projects it's recommended you install Composer globally, otherwise locally works fine too." />}}

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) `>= 2.0`
- PHP ``>= 7.4``
- WordPress ``>= 5.7`` (older versions may not be supported in the future)

## The Easy Way

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This method requires Composer to be installed globally." />}}

Let Composer create a new better-wordpress theme for you! Navigate to your site's `./wp-content/themes` folder and run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project open-function-computers-llc/wp-theme <theme-name>
```

Next, enter your newly created theme's folder and run `npm install`.

```bash
cd <theme-name>
npm install
```

This will install support for Laravel Mix, which can be used to compile Sass, PostCSS, Vue, React and more, as well as handle vanilla JavaScript/CSS. ([laravel-mix website](https://laravel-mix.com/))

The starter project contains example `app.scss` and `app.js` files in the `src` folder, to compile them simply run:

```bash
npx mix
```

To continuously monitor/rebuild `app.js` and `app.scss`, you can use:

```bash
npx mix watch
```

`better-wordpress` will automatically register the javascript and css with WordPress, just make sure you call [`wp_head()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_head/) in your site's `<head>` ([example](../laravel-mix/#including-scriptsstyles)).

## The Advanced Way

Navigate to your theme's folder within the WordPress file structure (by default `wp-content/themes/<theme>`) and run the following command to install `open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress` and its dependancies to your project.

```bash
# Composer Globally Installed
composer require open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress

# Composer Locally Installed
php composer.phar require open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress
```


### Add Configuration File

Once you've installed the package, navigate to `vendor/open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress` and copy `config.example.php` to the root of your theme folder. Rename this file simply to `config.php`.

Here's what your theme folder should look like now:
```
style.css # Required by WordPress
index.php # Required by WordPress
screenshot.png # Required by WordPress
config.php # Renamed example better-wordpress config
composer.json # Generated by Composer
vendor/ # Generated by Composer
| open-function-computers/
| | better-wordpress/
| | | config.example.php # Original example better-wordpress config
| | | ... # Other package files
| ... # Other packages
... # Other theme files
```
